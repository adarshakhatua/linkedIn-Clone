            <h1 className="heading1">About</h1>
            <p className="smallTxt1">I am a Mechanical Engineer by qualification, but my curiosity took me to coding and I fell in love with it instantly. I wrote a code for the first time in JavaScript and it has been a endless passion since then. I believe in the power of coding and that it can improve the lives of people around the world.
                With that belief, I took a leap of faith and started the remarkable Web Development course at Masai School. Currently, I acquired technical skills and programming languages like HTML, CSS ,JavaScript and MERN. How to solve Data Structure and Algorithms problems, Web Application Design Principles, Model View Controller (MVC) and Database.
                During this course, I have worked on three collaborative projects and many individual projects. I strongly believe that I am gravitated towards tech and new technologies within this journey but there is still so much to learn and I am grabbing all that is possible for me to create impactful web applications as an web developer about programming languages, frameworks that I can integrate into coding.
                In my spare time, I love to cook.

                I enjoy interacting with others from the field of technology and design. Feel free to drop me a message.</p>
